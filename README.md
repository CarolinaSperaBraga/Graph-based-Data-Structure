# Graph-based Data Structure

## Project Purpose Description

This project implements a **graph-based data structure** to model and manage the relationships between different nodes in a network. The core focus is on simulating the connections between nodes and providing efficient operations to manipulate and query these relationships. The graph represents an undirected network where nodes can be connected by edges, and operations can be performed to manage these connections.

### Key Features:
- **Graph Representation**: Nodes represent entities in a network, and edges represent the relationships or connections between them.
- **Basic Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: Establishes a connection (edge) between two nodes in the graph.
  - **Removal**: Removes an existing connection between two nodes.
  - **Adjacency Check**: Verifies whether two nodes are directly connected.
  - **Neighboring Nodes**: Lists all nodes directly connected to a given node.
  - **Graph Printing**: Outputs the entire graph, displaying all nodes and their respective connections.

### Purpose:
The project serves as a foundational tool for simulating and managing complex **network structures** where entities are interconnected. It allows for efficient querying and manipulation of connections between nodes, making it applicable to various use cases in areas such as:

- **Network Analysis**: Modeling and exploring networks, such as social networks, communication networks, or transportation networks.
- **Resource Management**: Managing relationships in a system where resources (nodes) interact with one another.
- **Optimization Problems**: Solving problems that require finding optimal paths or connections within a network.
